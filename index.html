            <p>Hiya! My name is Paulo Martin, Iâ€™m an environmentalist from Humboldt county. During the pandemic I was going to Humboldt State University working towards my environmental resource engineering degree. Since everything has gone online, I wanted to put down that path for now and work on a project that impacts the environment through coding. While going to school I worked for an outdoor recreation on campus helping Military Veterans transition to school. Before going to California to go to University I enlisted in the US Army as a canon crew member in Camp Casey, Dungducheon, South Korea. One of my major roles I served for the unit was the Company Armorer where I maintained, serviced, secured and recorded company weaponry/equipment for my company of 250 soldiers. After serving I spent time working in the Philippines trading bitcoins at local exchanges and working on a networking algorithms to create a mesh network.</p>
